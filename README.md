# Pancake_Game
A pancake stacking game created for APCS Final in 2017

Pancake is a game created with Java. 
Players are challenged to stack pancakes falling from the sky onto a plate, but the speed at which the pancakes fall increase for every 5 pancakes you stack. 
Each pancake you are able to stack counts as a point, and the stack of pancakes are cleared every time falling speed increases.
